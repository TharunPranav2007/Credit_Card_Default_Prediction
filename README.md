Key Features
  1) Data Processing: Uses pandas for efficient data cleaning, feature engineering, and transformation
  2) Machine Learning: Implements classification models to predict payment defaults
  3) Interactive Dashboard: Streamlit-powered web interface for easy model interaction
  4) Visual Analytics: Comprehensive visualizations of customer behavior patterns
  5) Model Evaluation: Performance metrics and explainability features

Technical Stack

  1) Python 3 with pandas for data manipulation
  2) Streamlit for the web application interface
  3) Scikit-learn for machine learning models
  4) Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualizations
  5) Optional: SHAP for model explainability
