This repository contains a Python-based machine learning project for predicting credit card default risk using pandas and Streamlit. The application helps financial institutions assess the likelihood of customers defaulting on their credit card payments.

Key Features
  1) Data Processing: Uses pandas for efficient data cleaning, feature engineering, and transformation
  2) Machine Learning: Implements classification models to predict payment defaults
  3) Interactive Dashboard: Streamlit-powered web interface for easy model interaction
  4) Visual Analytics: Comprehensive visualizations of customer behavior patterns
  5) Model Evaluation: Performance metrics and explainability features

Technical Stack

  1) Python 3 with pandas for data manipulation
  2) Streamlit for the web application interface
  3) Scikit-learn for machine learning models
  4) Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualizations
  5) Optional: SHAP for model explainability
